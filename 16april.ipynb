    "#1 Boosting is a method used in machine learning to reduce errors in predictive data analysis. Data scientists train machine learning software, called machine learning models, on labeled data to make guesses about unlabeled data. A single machine learning model might make prediction errors depending on the accuracy of the training dataset. For example, if a cat-identifying model has been trained only on images of white cats, it may occasionally misidentify a black cat. Boosting tries to overcome this issue by training multiple models sequentially to improve the accuracy of the overall system."
